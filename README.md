## Installation and setup

#### Create and activate a new `conda` environment:
```bash
!conda create -n summertime python=3.7
!conda activate summertime
```

#### `pip` dependencies for local demo:
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### Setup `ROUGE`
```bash
!export ROUGE_HOME=/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/summ_eval/ROUGE-1.5.5/
!pip install -U  git+https://github.com/bheinzerling/pyrouge.git
```



## Quick Start
Imports model, initializes default model, and summarizes sample documents.
```python
import model as st_model

model = st_model.summarizer()
documents = [
    """ PG&E stated it scheduled the blackouts in response to forecasts for high winds amid dry conditions. 
    The aim is to reduce the risk of wildfires. Nearly 800 thousand customers were scheduled to be affected 
    by the shutoffs which were expected to last through at least midday tomorrow."""
]
model.summarize(documents)

# ["California's largest electricity provider has turned off power to hundreds of thousands of customers."]
```

Also, please run our colab notebook for a more hands-on demo and more examples.

## Models

### Supported Models
SummerTime supports different models (e.g., TextRank, BART, Longformer) as well as model wrappers for more complex summariztion tasks (e.g., JointModel for multi-doc summarzation, BM25 retrieval for query-based summarization).

| Models                    | Single-doc           | Multi-doc            | Dialogue-based       | Query-based          |
| ---------                 | :------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: | 
| BartModel                 | :heavy_check_mark:   |                      |                      |                      |   
| BM25SummModel             |                      |                      |                      | :heavy_check_mark:   | 
| HMNetModel                |                      |                      | :heavy_check_mark:   |                      |
| LexRankModel              | :heavy_check_mark:   |                      |                      |                      |
| LongformerModel           | :heavy_check_mark:   |                      |                      |                      |
| MultiDocJointModel        |                      | :heavy_check_mark:   |                      |                      |
| MultiDocSeparateModel     |                      | :heavy_check_mark:   |                      |                      |
| PegasusModel              | :heavy_check_mark:   |                      |                      |                      |
| TextRankModel             | :heavy_check_mark:   |                      |                      |                      |
| TFIDFSummModel            |                      |                      |                      | :heavy_check_mark:   |                   |

To see all supported models, run:

```python
from model import SUPPORTED_SUMM_MODELS
print(SUPPORTED_SUMM_MODELS)
```


### Import and initialization:
```python
import model as st_model

# To use a default model
default_model = st_model.summarizer()    

# Or a specific model
bart_model = st_model.BartModel()
pegasus_model = st_model.PegasusModel()
lexrank_model = st_model.LexRankModel()
textrank_model = st_model.TextRankModel()
```

Users can easily access documentation to assist with model selection
```python
sample_model.show_capability()
pegasus_model.show_capability()
textrank_model.show_capability()
```

To use a model for summarization, simply run:
```python
documents = [
    """ PG&E stated it scheduled the blackouts in response to forecasts for high winds amid dry conditions. 
    The aim is to reduce the risk of wildfires. Nearly 800 thousand customers were scheduled to be affected 
    by the shutoffs which were expected to last through at least midday tomorrow."""
]

sample_model.summarize(documents)
# or 
pegasus_model.summarize(documents)
```

All models can be initialized with the following optional options:
```python
def __init__(self,
         trained_domain: str=None,
         max_input_length: int=None,
         max_output_length: int=None,
         ):
```

All models will implement the following methods:
```python
def summarize(self,
  corpus: Union[List[str], List[List[str]]],
  queries: List[str]=None) -> List[str]:

def show_capability(cls) -> None:
```



## Datasets

### Datasets supported
SummerTime supports different summarization datasets across different domains (e.g., CNNDM dataset - news article corpus, Samsum - dialogue corpus, QM-Sum - query-based dialogue corpus, MultiNews - multi-document corpus, ML-sum - multi-lingual corpus, PubMedQa - Medical domain, Arxiv - Science papers domain, among others.

To see all supported datasets, run:

```python
import dataset

print(dataset.list_all_dataset())
``` 

### Dataset Initialization
```python
import dataset

cnn_dataset = dataset.CnndmDataset()
# or 
xsum_dataset = dataset.XsumDataset()
# ..etc
```

##### Dataset Object
All datasets are implementations of the `SummDataset` class. Their data splits can be accessed as follows:
```python
dataset = dataset.CnndmDataset()

train_data = dataset.train_set  
dev_data = dataset.dev_set  
test_data = dataset.test_set        
```
To see the details of the datasets, run:
```python
dataset = dataset.CnndmDataset()

dataset.show_description()
```

##### Data instance
The data in all datasets is contained in a `SummInstance` class object, which has the following properties:
```python
data_instance.source = source    # either `List[str]` or `str`, depending on the dataset itself, string joining may needed to fit into specific models.
data_instance.summary = summary  # a string summary that serves as ground truth
data_instance.query = query      # Optional, applies when a string query is present

print(data_instance)             # to print the data instance in its entirety
```

### Loading and using data instances
Data is loaded using a generator to save on space and time

#### To get a single instance
```python
data_instance = next(cnn_dataset.train_set)
print(data_instance)
```

#### To get a slice of the dataset
```python
import itertools

# Get a slice from the train set generator - first 5 instances
train_set = itertools.islice(cnn_dataset.train_set, 5)

corpus = [instance.source for instance in train_set]
print(corpus)
```


## Using the datasets with the models - Examples
```python
import itertools
import dataset
import model

cnn_dataset = dataset.CnndmDataset()


# Get a slice of the train set - first 5 instances
train_set = itertools.islice(cnn_dataset.train_set, 5)

corpus = [instance.source for instance in train_set]


# Example 1 - traditional non-neural model
# LexRank model
lexrank = model.LexRankModel(corpus)
print(lexrank.show_capability())

lexrank_summary = lexrank.summarize(corpus)
print(lexrank_summary)


# Example 2 - A spaCy pipeline for TextRank (another non-neueral extractive summarization model)
# TextRank model
textrank = model.TextRankModel()
print(textrank.show_capability())

textrank_summary = textrank.summarize(corpus)
print(textrank_summary)


# Example 3 - A neural model to handle large texts
# LongFormer Model
longformer = model.LongFormerModel()
longformer.show_capability()

longformer_summary = longformer.summarize(corpus)
print(longformer_summary)
```



## Evaluation
SummerTime supports different evaluation metrics including: BertScore, Bleu, Meteor, Rouge, RougeWe

To print all supported metrics:
```python
from evaluation import SUPPORTED_EVALUATION_METRICS

print(SUPPORTED_EVALUATION_METRICS)
```

### Import and initialization:
```python
import evaluation as st_eval

bert_eval = st_eval.bertscore()
bleu_eval = st_eval.bleu_eval()
meteor_eval = st_eval.bleu_eval()
rouge_eval = st_eval.rouge()
rougewe_eval = st_eval.rougewe()
```

### Evaluation Class
All evaluation metrics can be initialized with the following optional arguments:
```python
def __init__(self, metric_name):
```

All evaluation metric objects implement the following methods:
```python
def evaluate(self, model, data):

def get_dict(self, keys):
```

### Using evaluation metrics
Get sample summary data
```python
from evaluation.base_metric import SummMetric
from evaluation import Rouge, RougeWe, BertScore

import itertools

# Evaluates model on subset of cnn_dailymail
# Get a slice of the train set - first 5 instances
train_set = itertools.islice(cnn_dataset.train_set, 5)

corpus = [instance for instance in train_set]
print(corpus)

articles = [instance.source for instance in corpus]

summaries = sample_model.summarize(articles)
targets = [instance.summary for instance in corpus]
```

Evaluate the data on different metrics
```python
from evaluation import  BertScore, Rouge, RougeWe,

# Calculate BertScore
bert_metric = BertScore()
bert_score = bert_metric.evaluate(summaries, targets)
print(bert_score)

# Calculate Rouge
rouge_metric = Rouge()
rouge_score = rouge_metric.evaluate(summaries, targets)
print(rouge_score)

# Calculate RougeWe
rougewe_metric = RougeWe()
rougwe_score = rougewe_metric.evaluate(summaries, targets)
print(rougewe_score)
```


### Using automatic pipeline assembly
Given a SummerTime dataset, you may use the `pipelines.assemble_model_pipeline` function to retrieve a list of initialized SummerTime models that are compatible with the dataset provided.

```python
from pipeline import assemble_model_pipeline
from dataset.dataset_loaders import CnndmDataset, QMsumDataset

single_doc_models = assemble_model_pipeline(CnndmDataset)
# [
#   (<model.single_doc.bart_model.BartModel object at 0x7fcd43aa12e0>, 'BART'),
#   (<model.single_doc.lexrank_model.LexRankModel object at 0x7fcd43aa1460>, 'LexRank'),
#   (<model.single_doc.longformer_model.LongformerModel object at 0x7fcd43b17670>, 'Longformer'),
#   (<model.single_doc.pegasus_model.PegasusModel object at 0x7fccb84f2910>, 'Pegasus'),
#   (<model.single_doc.textrank_model.TextRankModel object at 0x7fccb84f2880>, 'TextRank')
# ]

query_based_multi_doc_models = assemble_model_pipeline(QMsumDataset)
# [
#   (<model.query_based.tf_idf_model.TFIDFSummModel object at 0x7fc9c9c81e20>, 'TF-IDF (HMNET)'),
#   (<model.query_based.bm25_model.BM25SummModel object at 0x7fc8b4fa8c10>, 'BM25 (HMNET)')
# ]
```


## To contribute

### Pull requests
Create a pull request and name it [`your_gh_username`]/[`your_branch_name`]. If needed, resolve your own branch's merge conflicts with main. Do not push directly to main.

### Code formatting
If you haven't already, install `black` and `flake8`:

```bash
pip install black
pip install flake8
```

Before pushing commits or merging branches, run the following commands from the project root. Note that `black` will write to files, and that you should add and commit changes made by `black` before pushing:

```bash
black .
flake8 .
```

Or if you would like to lint specific files:

```bash
black path/to/specific/file.py
flake8 path/to/specific/file.py
```

Ensure that `black` does not reformat any files and that `flake8` does not print any errors. If you would like to override or ignore any of the preferences or practices enforced by `black` or `flake8`, please leave a comment in your PR for any lines of code that generate warning or error logs. Do not directly edit config files such as `setup.cfg`.

See the [`black` docs](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [`flake8` docs](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/index.html) for documentation on installation, ignoring files/lines, and advanced usage. In addition, the following may be useful:

- `black [file.py] --diff` to preview changes as diffs instead of directly making changes
- `black [file.py] --check` to preview changes with status codes instead of directly making changes
- `git diff -u | flake8 --diff` to only run flake8 on working branch changes


Note that our CI test suite will include invoking `black --check .` and `flake8 --count .` on all non-unittest and non-setup Python files, and zero error-level output is required for all tests to pass.

### Tests
Our continuous integration system is provided through [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). When any pull request is created or updated or whenever `main` is updated, the repository's unit tests will be run as build jobs on tangra for that pull request. Build jobs will either pass or fail within a few minutes, and build statuses and logs are visible under [Actions](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/SummerTime/actions). Please ensure that the most recent commit in pull requests passes all checks (i.e. all steps in all jobs run to completion) before merging, or request a review. To skip a build on any particular commit, append `[skip ci]` to the commit message. Note that PRs with the substring `/no-ci/` anywhere in the branch name will not be included in CI.
